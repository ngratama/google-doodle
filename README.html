<p>I created this google doodle using Illustrator and GSAP to animate it. The google doodle has a steam punk style and that style is represented though gears, ropes, hooks and steam stacks. Over all I think this google doodle is very affective and visually interesting for displaying the Idea that I was intending. </p>
